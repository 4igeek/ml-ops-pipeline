# End-To-End MLOps Pipeline
An End-To-End MLOps Pipeline Using AWS SageMaker.

Please read [Configuring AWS & Local Environment for MLOps Pipelines Project](https://digitalredneck.co.uk/configuring-aws-local-environment-for-mlops-pipelines-project/) before attempting to use this project as you will need to setup a local environment to get it to work.

Once you have completed all of the steps outlined in my blog post then take a look at the [End-To-End MLOps Pipeline](https://github.com/4igeek/ml-ops-pipeline/blob/main/program/main.ipynb) which is found by visiting `program > main.ipynb` (or by clicking on the link).
